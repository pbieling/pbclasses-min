# pbclasses-min

A minimal version of PbClasses by Peter Bieling - https://p-bieling.de/

## Description

The classes **PbTpl** and **PdoSql** in thie package are part of a PHP framework called *PbClasses* that I use for my PHP projects for many years. 
The entire framework is not yet freely available, but I have now published the two most important classes in this minimal 
version.

For **PbTpl** you can find more Informatione in a little tutorial [PbTpl-demo](https://github.com/pbieling/pbtpl-demo)

A second tutorial for the use of the database class **SqlPdo** will follow soon.

I'm working on more detailed information at this point. Until then, you can use the information from the [test folder](https://github.com/pbieling/pbclasses-min/tree/main/test). 
There is a test file for each class
